Mutenroshi Escape is a *small 2D perspective puzzle* for end-of-course work.

It is made entirely in **C # using the Tao.SDL library**.

I'm in love with this one because is the first "complete application" I made, and for the good time I had designing and programming the game.

*Obviously, it's a beginner's job. But I keep it here for the good memories.*
